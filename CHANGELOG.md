## [Unreleased]
### Added
- new option to `ADLSToAzureSQL` Flow - `if_exists="delete"`

### Fixed
- authorization issue within `CloudForCustomers` source

## [0.2.13]
### Added
- Added support for file path to `CloudForCustomersReportToADLS` flow

### Fixed
- `Supermetrics` source: `to_df()` now correctly handles `if_empty` in case of empty results

### Changed
- `Sharepoint` and `CloudForCustomers` sources will now provide an informative `CredentialError` which is also raised early. This will make issues with input credenials immediately clear to the user.
- Removed set_key_value from `CloudForCustomersReportToADLS` flow

## [0.2.7] - 2021-10-04
### Added
- Added `SQLiteQuery` task
- Added `CloudForCustomers` source
- Added `CloudForCustomersToDF` and `CloudForCustomersToCSV` tasks
- Added `CloudForCustomersToADLS` flow
- Added support for parquet in `CloudForCustomersToDF`
- Added style guidelines to the `README`
- Added local setup and commands to the `README`

### Changed
- Changed CI/CD algorithm
  - the `latest` Docker image is now only updated on release and is the same exact image as the latest release
  - the `dev` image is released only on pushes and PRs to the `dev` branch (so dev branch = dev image)
- Modified `ADLSToAzureSQL` - *read_sep* and *write_sep* parameters added to the flow.

### Fixed
- Fixed `ADLSToAzureSQL` breaking in `"append"` mode if the table didn't exist (#145).
- Fixed `ADLSToAzureSQL` breaking in promotion path for csv files. 

## [0.2.6] - 2021-09-22
### Added
- Added flows library docs to the references page

### Changed
- Moved task library docs page to topbar
- Updated docs for task and flows


## [0.2.5] - 2021-09-20
### Added
- Added `start` and `end_date` parameters to `SupermetricsToADLS` flow
- Added a tutorial on how to pull data from `Supermetrics`


## [0.2.4] - 2021-09-06
### Added
- Added documentation (both docstrings and MKDocs docs) for multiple tasks
- Added `start_date` and `end_date` parameters to the `SupermetricsToAzureSQL` flow
- Added a temporary workaround `df_to_csv_task` task to the `SupermetricsToADLS` flow to handle mixed dtype columns not handled automatically by DataFrame's `to_parquet()` method


## [0.2.3] - 2021-08-19
### Changed
- Modified `RunGreatExpectationsValidation` task to use the built in support for evaluation parameters added in Prefect v0.15.3
- Modified `SupermetricsToADLS` and `ADLSGen1ToAzureSQLNew` flows to align with this [recipe](https://docs.prefect.io/orchestration/flow_config/storage.html#loading-additional-files-with-git-storage) for reading the expectation suite JSON
The suite now has to be loaded before flow initialization in the flow's python file and passed as an argument to the flow's constructor.
- Modified `RunGreatExpectationsValidation`'s `expectations_path` parameter to point to the directory containing the expectation suites instead of the
Great Expectations project directory, which was confusing. The project directory is now only used internally and not exposed to the user
- Changed the logging of docs URL for `RunGreatExpectationsValidation` task to use GE's recipe from [the docs](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/guides/validation/advanced/how_to_implement_custom_notifications/)

### Added
- Added a test for `SupermetricsToADLS` flow
 -Added a test for `AzureDataLakeList` task
- Added PR template for new PRs
- Added a `write_to_json` util task to the `SupermetricsToADLS` flow. This task dumps the input expectations dict to the local filesystem as is required by Great Expectations.
This allows the user to simply pass a dict with their expectations and not worry about the project structure required by Great Expectations
- Added `Shapely` and `imagehash` dependencies required for full `visions` functionality (installing `visions[all]` breaks the build)
- Added more parameters to control CSV parsing in the `ADLSGen1ToAzureSQLNew` flow
- Added `keep_output` parameter to the `RunGreatExpectationsValidation` task to control Great Expectations output to the filesystem
- Added `keep_validation_output` parameter and `cleanup_validation_clutter` task to the `SupermetricsToADLS` flow to control Great Expectations output to the filesystem

### Removed
- Removed `SupermetricsToAzureSQLv2` and `SupermetricsToAzureSQLv3` flows
